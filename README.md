## How to use
* Download emulator from [here](https://www.fightcade.com/) and find the proper roms
* Download the archive from [here](https://github.com/Grouflon/3rd_training_lua/archive/master.zip) or clone repository
* Extract the archive anywhere on your computer
* Start the emulator, load the rom, start a match with P1 and P2 (you will need to map input for both players)
* Go to Game->Lua Scripting->New Lua Script Window and run the script **3rd_training.lua** from here
* Follow instructions from the Output Console

## Shortcut - Windows
* Create a shortcut for the emulator, usually in the Fightcade folder under `emulator\fbneo\fcadefbneo.exe`
* Right-click the shortcut and select `Properties`
* In the `Target` section, after the path to `fcadefbneo.exe`, add ` sfiii3nr1 --lua 3rd_training.lua` - ideally using the full path for the 3rd training lua e.g `C:\Users\me\Fightcade\3rd_training_lua-master\3rd_training.lua`
* Click `OK` and double-click the new shortcut to launch 3rd strike with the training mode enabled

This training mode is still in development and you may encounter bugs or missing features while using it. Please report any bug on the **#bugs** channel, and any feature request on the **#features** channel of the discord server.

If you wish to contribute or give any feedback, feel free to get in touch or submit pull requests.

## Troubleshooting
**Q: Missing rom, zip file not found**

A: Make sure you have the proper roms. You must have at least 2 roms: _sfiii3.zip_ and _sfiii3a.zip_. sfiii3 is the japanese version and the zip contains _sfiii3_japan_nocd.29f400.u2_. sfiiia is the american version and contains _sfiii3_usa.29f400.u2_.

You may need to rename zip files so they match exactly what the emulator expect for.

**Q: When I run the script, the characters can no longer move**

A: You are probably using the script on FBA-RR which is not supported anymore, in order to benefit from the last features and improvement you must run the script on Fightcade2's FBNeo emulator. However if you still want to use FBA-RR, you can go back to v0.6 which was the last version supported on FBA-RR.

**Q: Emulator crash when I run lua script**

A: Check video settings, you musn't use "Enhanced" blitter option.

**Q: UI looks weird and hitboxes are misplaced**

A: Check video settings, you must use "Basic" blitter option with no scanlines if you want the UI to work properly.

**Q: Emulator doesn't run at all, there's a missing dll**

A: Install prerequires from [here](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-Prereqs/releases/latest/)

## Guard Jump
The way guard jump works is that there are situations where you are throw invulnerable (cannot be thrown). These situations are after a reset, knockdown and blocking or being hit by an attack. This unthrowable state lasts for 6 frames.  Guard jump should be input to block for this duration, jumping in a direction and then blocking again.

The current implementation of Counter-Attack Move does not work with how guard jump functions and needs to be input for all of these situations.  

This is because it requires pre-buffered frames of input (the assumption of holding block beforehand in this case).  

Because of its current implementation it will only work properly when knocked down. So in the other listed situations such as being reset or your opponent going for a tick throw, the Counter-Attack Move version in the dummy menu will get thrown if timed correctly.

To properly test guard jump in these situations you must use provided replays.

To use these replays go to the recording menu and follow these steps;

1. Pick a slot you wish to load the replay into
2. Navigate to "Load slot from file" and hit Light Punch
3. Use left and right on your lever or keyboard to navigate the files in your recordings folder and find the Guard Jump you wish to use.
4. Make sure the replay slot where this is loaded is active and replay mode is set to normal.
5. Set "Counter Attack - Delay" in the recording menu to -4 (NEGATIVE 4) for each Guard Jump replay used.
6. Navigate to the "Dummy" menu and set "Counter Attack - Move" to none, and "Counter Attack - Action" to recording.

Now every time your opponent is knocked down, is reset, blocks or gets hit it will attempt to guard jump in the direction of the replay used.

There are three files provided;
1. Neutral Guard jump
2. Guard Jump Back (most commonly used and is what Guard Jump in the Dummy menu currently uses)
3. Guard Jump Forward (To get out of the corner or just try to jump over you)


Providing these replays prevents headache for users figuring out how to properly generate these replays and make them function in any given situation where it is applicable.

Hopefully these replays helps users practice against this technique while the "Counter Attack" functionality is being re-written.  These replays won't be required forever unless you want to use them in some advanced use case.

But for now its best to add this feature so people can know of it's existence and provide replays for advanced players that wish to practice against it in non knockdown scenarios.

These replays are also provided for the purpose of randomized reaction or ordered reaction training for advanced users.

If you want randomization between the three replays then simply load each one into a different replay slot and use the "Random" replay mode with no other replay slots populated.

One such advanced use case example would be a Makoto player using the ability use replay weighting to simulate weighted decisions in order to practice post hayate mixups against an opponent that favors specific types of defensive options.

Thank you for your support in this matter and please enjoy!
